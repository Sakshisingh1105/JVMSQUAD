âœ… 1. Core Feature Implementation
Fully implemented client-server architecture

Supports multi-client messaging, real-time updates, and user commands (/help, /users, /stats, /time)

GUI is Telegram-inspired and modern

Thoroughly described in README.md, architecture.md, and actual source code


âœ… 2. Error Handling & Robustness
Implements validation (message length, format, empty inputs) as per architecture.md

Handles client disconnects, server shutdowns, and network issues gracefully

Code ensures resource cleanup and exception management



âœ… 3. Integration of Components
Seamless interaction between GUI (Swing) and network (Sockets + Threads)

Uses well-defined threading architecture (ClientHandler per client, background listener in client)

GUI and backend are tightly integrated



âœ… 4. Event Handling & Processing
Efficient use of ActionListener, KeyAdapter, and Swing thread (invokeLater())

Responsive client even during long-running operations (background threads for I/O)

Server and client are event-driven



âœ… 5. Data Validation
Enforced limits: 500 character cap, non-empty checks, command validation, username sanitization

Present both in server (Server.java) and client (Client.java) logic



ðŸŸ¢ 6. Code Quality & Innovation
Clean and modular code (ClientHandler, broadcastMessage, sendMessage)

GUI design is enhanced with modern styling and usability

Innovation present: commands, GUI design, real-time stats, but could further improve with features like private chat or emojis



âœ… 7. Project Documentation
Extremely well-documented:

README.md with setup, screenshots, commands, testing

architecture.md with technical deep dive

contributing.md with collaboration instructions

license.md with MIT license

GitHub-ready project_structure.md with CI/CD included
